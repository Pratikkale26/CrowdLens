# 🧠 CrowdLens

**CrowdLens** is a decentralized feedback engine where creators and AI teams get real human validation on content — through tokenized micro-tasks powered by the Solana ecosystem.

Built with ❤️ for the new wave of **AI x Web3 x DePIN** tools.

---

## 🌟 Project Motive

Today’s creators and AI developers are bottlenecked by one thing: **subjective decision-making**.

- “Which thumbnail works best?”
- “Which image looks fake or real?”
- “Which dataset sample is higher quality?”

These decisions require human judgment — not just analytics. Yet no scalable, incentive-aligned solution exists.

**CrowdLens** fixes this by turning content feedback into a micro-task network powered by real validators and on-chain incentives.

  Validators are paid in Solana tokens per completed batch
