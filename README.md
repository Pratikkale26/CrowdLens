## 🤖 Why UpRock?

CrowdLens leverages **UpRock’s mobile-first DePIN network** to source genuine, diverse human feedback at scale.  
UpRock contributors-real people running the UpRock app-participate in voting rounds, providing unbiased, high-quality data for creators.  
This ensures that when you’re choosing the best thumbnail, title, or design, you’re getting honest opinions from a global pool of real users, not bots or click farms[1].
