      question: "How does CrowdLens collect feedback from real users?",
      answer: "CrowdLens leverages the UpRock DePIN network, a decentralized community of real users who provide genuine feedback on your content. These users are verified through blockchain technology and incentivized to give honest opinions. You get data from actual people, not algorithms or bots.",
      isOpen: false,
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get results?",
      answer: "Most tests deliver complete results within 2-4 hours, depending on your target audience specifications. Our network includes users worldwide, so you can get feedback 24/7. For highly specific demographics, it might take slightly longer.",
      isOpen: false,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I target specific demographics for my thumbnail tests?",
      answer: "Absolutely! With our Professional and Agency plans, you can target users based on age, gender, location, interests, and viewing habits. This ensures you're getting feedback from the same type of audience that typically watches your content.",
      isOpen: false,
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the feedback compared to actual YouTube performance?",
      answer: "Our clients report that CrowdLens predictions align with actual YouTube performance on average 87% of the time. This is significantly better than creator intuition alone (typically 50-60% accurate) or traditional focus groups.",
      isOpen: false,
    },
    {
      question: "Is my content secure when I upload it for testing?",
      answer: "Yes, we take security seriously. Your thumbnails are encrypted, access-controlled, and only shown to users participating in your specific test. We also have built-in protections against screenshot capturing and unauthorized downloading.",
      isOpen: false,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I test other content besides thumbnails?",
      answer: "Yes! While thumbnails are our most popular test type, you can also test video titles, descriptions, channel banners, and even short intro clips to optimize all aspects of your content strategy.",
